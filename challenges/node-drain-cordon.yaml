  On cluster cka-b, a worker node needs maintenance.
  1. Mark node 'cka-b-worker' as unschedulable (cordon)
  2. Safely evict all pods from the node (drain), ignoring DaemonSets
  3. After verifying no user workloads remain, mark the node as schedulable again (uncordon)
  4. Verify the node is Ready and schedulable
  
  Hint: Use kubectl drain with --ignore-daemonsets and --delete-emptydir-data flags
