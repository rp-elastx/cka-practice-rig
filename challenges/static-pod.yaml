  On cluster cka-b:
  1. Identify the static pod manifest directory on the control plane node
     (typically /etc/kubernetes/manifests)
  2. Create a static pod manifest 'static-web.yaml' that runs nginx:1.24 
     with name 'static-web' in namespace 'default'
  3. Verify the static pod is created and Running
  4. Find all static pods in the cluster (they have node name in their pod name)
     Save the list to /tmp/static-pods.txt
  5. Document the static pod path in /tmp/static-pod-path.txt
  
  Hint: Static pods are managed by kubelet directly from manifest files
